This example shows how DROP can manipulate a protein structure from an extended chain to its native fold.

NOTE: There are no dynamics happening here. The dihedral angles of the Villin Headpiece crystal structure are known and DROP is being told to change the backbone dihedral angles to the correct orientations. This is not an example of "solved" protein folding.

This example contains the following:
- ```fold-villin.sh```: bash script to call the drop executable to change one backbone dihedral at a time
- ```villin-unfolded.pdb```: Villin Headpiece pdb generated by the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software. Molefacture->Protein Builder was used to generate this extended structure
- ```villin-unfolded-conect.pdb```: ```DROP/scripts/generate-conect-gromacs.sh``` was used to take ```villin-unfolded.pdb``` and generate conect records with a series of gromacs commands
- ```villin_backbone_ramachandran_angles.txt```: List the dihedral angles of Villin Headpiece residues 2 to 35 (terminal residues don't have both dihedrals defined) ```villin_backbone_ramachandran_angles_labeled.txt``` also lists the residue name and number, but is for convenience and not used for the script

Executing ```fold-villin.sh``` currently leads to seg fault...
